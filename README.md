# Rock Paper Scissors

This was one of my first projects in my journey learning to code. 

What challenged me: when creating this project, it was my first time working with creating something with Javascript. At first I struggled getting all of the If/Else statements to work together, but after a while I really got the hang of it. Also, although a very small amount, I added some DOM Manipulation to this project which I found to be really interesting.

Thank you!
